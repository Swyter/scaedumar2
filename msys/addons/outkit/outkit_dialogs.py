#-#######################################

# About the placement: in the example build, I've placed the dialogs
#  at the end of module_dialogs. You can place it anywhere, but know that
#  if you have other patrol talks, like Diplomacy's, they might override these.
#  Be sure to have these dialogs placed BEFORE any conflicting others.

# There's also a possible bug with the beginning merchant's dialogs,
# if you put these too much to the start of the file.
