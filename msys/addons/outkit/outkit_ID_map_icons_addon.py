# Lumos: If you get an error for "icon_outpost" not defined,
#        just grab these two lines below and stuff them in your
#        ID_map_icons.py file, BUT be careful about the nomeration.
#
#        If the last map icon is "icon_something = 194", then you
#        need to put numbers 195 and 196 for icon_outpost and
#        icon_fort_a respectively.
#
#        The given numbers are good for the normal number of icons:
#        if your mod doesn't add new icons, you can use these.
#
#        Ha-ha, I wrote a short story... ;)

icon_outpost = 189
icon_fort_a = 190
